## About Me

Hi! I'm Elizabeth Lawrence, an ecologist by training with a love for all things marine.

I am an enthusiastic and organized biologist. I have a range of interests, including: biodiversity science, statistical ecology, teaching/training, applied conservation, field ecology, and macro-ecology. I love learning new techniques and especially enjoy working with data. To read more about my research interests and experience, click here.

I did my undergrad in marine biology and have a special place in my heart for marine science, especially anything fish-related. I have a range of statistical and teaching experience, where I am currently putting my skills to use as Capacity Development Officer at OBIS (Ocean Biodiversity Information System).

## Extra-curricular Activities

When I'm not behind the screen working, I like to participate in various physical activities. Whether that is hiking with friends, camping, or (more frequently) doing martial arts. I spend a great deal of my free time on the mats grappling. I started judo in September 2010 and have loved it ever since, obtaining my first degree black belt in June 2016. I was the first Sarnia-born female judoka to obtain her black belt and you can read about that in the local newspaper [here](http://www.theobserver.ca/2016/06/26/elizabeth-lawrence-is-the-only-local-female-athlete-to-earn-a-black-belt).

Currently, I practice Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I received my blue belt in September 2020 - just after my PhD defense! I find having a physical outlet keeps my mind sharp and productive during the work week.

In addition to practicing martial arts, I also enjoy artistic expression and music. I started learning the violin in 2023 as I've always really loved the instrument, and am now learning how to play Irish music! While I still really enjoy painting with acrylics, drawing, and clay sculpting, time is of course limited, so these days my artistic skills are used to occasionally create infographics at work. However, you can look at some of my more traditional artwork here.

Finally, I like to spend time playing Dungeons and Dragons with friends when schedules allow. I find such an outlet allows for creative problem solving and practice improvising solutions as a team.
